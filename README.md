# Glib-Eventable

This is a helper gem for [ruby-gnome2][gtk] applications.

Instead of writing:

```ruby
class Window < Gtk::Window
  def initialize
    signal_connect('destroy') { Gtk.main_quit }
  end
end
```

This allows you to write:

```ruby
class Window < Gtk::Window
  event destroy: :on_destroy
  
  def on_destroy
    Gtk.main_quit
  end
end
```

Or simply:

```ruby
class Window < Gtk::Window
  event destroy: -> { Gtk.main_quit }
end
```

This allows you to create subclasses of `Gtk` objects in a more OOP style.

## Install

    iter = @column.tree_view.model.get_iter(path)

    when 'Stopped' then 'Running'
    end
